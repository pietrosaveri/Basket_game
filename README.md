### Ball Trajectory Game
---
# Overview

This Python project is a simple game built using Pygame, where the player needs to throw a ball into a basket by selecting the correct trajectory and force. The game involves physics calculations, such as gravity and ball movement, making it an engaging way to practice your aim and test your understanding of projectile motion.

The goal of the game is to adjust the trajectory (angle) and set the right force (velocity) to successfully score the ball into the basket. The game simulates a real-world environment with gravity and air resistance, making the gameplay both challenging and fun.
